# 🎯 Can't Find "General"? Here's What to Look For

## Step-by-Step Visual Guide

### 1. Make Sure You're in Settings Tab

At the top of your project page, you should see tabs:
- Overview
- Deployments  
- Analytics
- **Settings** ← Click this tab first!

### 2. Look for the Sidebar

Once you're in Settings, you should see a **left sidebar** with options like:
- **General** ← This is what you need!
- Domains
- Environment Variables
- Git
- Functions

### 3. Alternative: Look for "Root Directory" Directly

If you don't see a sidebar, just scroll down on the Settings page and look for:
- **"Root Directory"** section
- It might show: `./` or be empty
- Click **"Edit"** button next to it

## 🔄 Alternative Method (Easier!)

### Delete & Re-import (Fresh Start)

This might be faster:

1. **Delete current project**:
   - Settings → scroll to bottom
   - Click "Delete Project"
   - Confirm deletion

2. **Re-import from GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/new
   - Click "Import Git Repository"
   - Select: `Midhun-we/AI-Micro-Business-Tech`

3. **BEFORE clicking Deploy**:
   - Look for "Root Directory" field
   - Click "Edit" or the field
   - Type: **`client`**
   - NOW click "Deploy"

This ensures the Root Directory is set correctly from the start!
